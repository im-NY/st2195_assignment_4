## Practice Assignment 04

Create a GitHub repository called “st2195_assignment_ 4”.
1. Commit/push the code below as a file called "foo.R". 

2. Find and fix all the bugs in the code [1 point is awarded for every fixed bug]. 
Instructions are given in the form of comments in the code.

3. Update "foo.R" by committing and pushing the revisions.

Additional Notes:

• Original code runs without errors, but nothing is printed on screen. However, there 
are a few bugs present. What was the process you took to debug the program?

Hints:

• You can place breakpoints or add browser() statement in code at locations you wish 
to stop and examine further. Maybe put one in each function – volume and 
volume_vector?

• volume function:
o Check task
o Check arguments
o Check variables
o Check what is returned

• volume_vector function:
o Check task
o Check variables/arguments
o Check what is returned – may need a data structure to store multiple values

• (Optional) Any redundant variables or statements
